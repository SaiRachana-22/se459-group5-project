_Sai Rachana Venna_

I'm currently pursuing MS in Computer Science and this is my 5th quarter at DePaul. I graduated with Bachelors in Computer Science back in 2020 and worked as a Software Engineer for 3 years. I have worked on few projects using Java, .Net and Python in the past. For this course, I'm comfortable working with Java for developing the Rogue game project following the Agile concepts.
